# ISS-locator - Ozkar Alvarez

This ISS Locator script that interacts with the HTML DOM tree is the first encounter I had with an API. I utilized the fetch API along with async/await syntax. The API calls the location and velocity endpoints to retrieve the data and display it to the user.

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>This appilcation utilizes an API call using fetch API along with async/await syntax. This project introduced me to the vast creative opportunity API's can deliver which lead me to create my first application using the <a href="https://wheretheiss.at/">Where the ISS at</a> REST API. I also used <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a> to create an HTML map with a dynamic icon that refreshes every second according to the position data retrieved from the ISS API. I used CSS media queries to make this application mobile responsive. This was where I ran into my first cross-browser styling issues such as margins not reacting the same on iPhone safari compared to android chrome.</p>
